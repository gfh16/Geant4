! this file is used to specify the particle that you want to use
! in this program you can specify two kinds of particle: common particle, like gamma, Lepton, which already
! defined in Geant4, you can use them directly by name; Heavy Ion, which is also already defined in Geant4,
! but you should use another method to specify them.
